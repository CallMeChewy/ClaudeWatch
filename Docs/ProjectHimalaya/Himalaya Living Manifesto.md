# 🏔️ Himalaya Living Manifesto — The Head Sherpa Principle

**Purpose:**  
Create a single, sticky, never-quicksand document to guide every human, agent, and future “Uber driver” working with this project.  
Every great climb needs both a trail map and a reason to climb. This is both.

**Version:** 1.0  
**Maintainers:** Herb Bowers & Navi (Head Sherpa, AI)  
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-05

## 🚩 The Head Sherpa Principle

> “Always give your Head Sherpa the big picture.”  
> — *Project Himalaya*

**Why?**  

- Code survives, teams thrive, and AI assistants *actually help* when they know the mission, not just the task.
- This document is your guarantee: every patch, feature, or “just do it” fix always fits the bigger journey.

---

## 1️⃣ The Big Picture

- **Mission:** Build and document software that outlasts us, delights to work on, and is always ready for new hands—AI or human.
- **Philosophy:**  
  - **Legacy over cleverness:** Leave every file clearer than you found it.
  - **Audit over ambiguity:** Code, decisions, and intent are always visible.
  - **Joy is mandatory:** If it’s not fun, it doesn’t belong in Himalaya.

---

## 2️⃣ How We Work

- Every major feature, bugfix, or experiment starts and ends with context:  
  - “Why are we doing this?”  
  - “Who needs to understand it next?”  
  - “Will it survive a hand-off to an Uber driver?”
- Every change, patch, or moonshot gets a quick summary below.

---

## 3️⃣ Legacy & Stretch Goals

- Leave no mystery: comments and commit messages are written for your *future self* and your *future AI copilot*.
- Every sprint, refactor, or “big push” gets logged below—what worked, what didn’t, and what we learned.
- Emoji, icons, or shortcodes are encouraged for accessibility and memory triggers.

---

## 4️⃣ Pain Points & Lessons Learned

- Record every stumbling block—setup, workflow, surprise bug, missing dependency.
- Never blame. Every pain point is a trail marker for the next climber.

---

## 5️⃣ Moonshots & Big Moves

- Every risky leap (feature or architectural) is named, logged, and summarized.
- If you try something wild and it works (or doesn’t), add it here with a “what we learned.”

---

## 6️⃣ Handoff & Uber Driver Hints

- Summarize the most critical install, config, and usage tips here.
- Note anything quirky or legacy-bound.
- List “never break” external dependencies.

---

## 7️⃣ AI/Agent Guidance

- If you’re an agent, always check for “big picture” and recent log entries before major changes.
- Never refactor, reformat, or delete without updating this document and pinging for a human/AI review if context is missing.

---

## 8️⃣ The Sherpa Summit Log (Living Timeline)

- **2025-06-05:**  
  - Himalaya Living Manifesto v1.0 adopted as project foundation.
  - Codebase, docs, and kit are now fully context-rich and handoff-safe.
- **[Add next entries as you climb…]**

---

## 🍰 How to Use This Doc (Sticky, Never Quicksand)

- Start every new project, team, or tool with this file.
- Update it *before* and *after* major changes.
- Reference, but never duplicate, the full standards doc (`AIDEV-PascalCase-1.7.md`).
- When in doubt:  
  - Pause and zoom out.  
  - Update the log.  
  - Share with the next climber.
