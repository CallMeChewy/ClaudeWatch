> how can i set up context7 mcp to use in claude code

● I'll help you set up Context7 MCP for use in Claude Code. Let me search for information about MCP setup
  and Context7 integration.

● Fetch(https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp)
  ⎿  Received 2.1MB (200 OK)

● Web Search("Context7 MCP server setup claude code installation")
  ⎿  Did 1 search in 40s                                                                                    

● Based on the documentation and search results, here's how to set up Context7 MCP in Claude Code:

  Quick Setup

  Add Context7 MCP server to Claude Code:
  claude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest

  For user-scoped access (available across all projects):
  claude mcp add context7 -s user -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest

  How to Use Context7

  Once installed, append use context7 to your coding prompts to fetch up-to-date documentation and code
  examples:

  How do I implement authentication in Next.js 14? use context7

  Context7 automatically fetches current documentation and injects it into your prompt context for more
  accurate responses.

  Verify Installation

  Check if Context7 is properly configured:
  claude mcp list

  You should see context7 in the list of available MCP servers.

  Alternative: Manual Configuration

  If you prefer manual config, edit your .claude.json file to include:
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "context7": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"]
      }
    }
  }

  The Context7 MCP server provides real-time, version-specific documentation access directly in your coding
  workflow.

   claude mcp add context7 -s user -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest

2. Verified installation - Context7 is now listed in your MCP servers

3. Configuration confirmed - The .claude.json file shows Context7 is properly configured:
   "context7": {
   "type": "stdio",
   "command": "npx",
   "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"],
   "env": {}
   }

   Context7 will automatically fetch current documentation and inject it into your prompt context for more
   accurate responses.

> will this be available in all projects or is there a global setup necessary

● The Context7 MCP server I installed is already globally available across all your projects!

  Here's why:

  Current Setup (Global)

  I used the -s user flag when installing:
  claude mcp add context7 -s user -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest

  This means Context7 is configured at the user scope, making it available in:

- ✅ All current projects

- ✅ All future projects

- ✅ Any directory you use Claude Code in
  
  MCP Server Scopes Explained:
1. User scope (-s user) - Global, available everywhere

2. Project scope (-s project) - Shared via .mcp.json in project root

3. Local scope (default) - Only in current project
   
   Verification:
   
   You can verify this works globally by running claude mcp list from any directory - Context7 will appear in
   the list.
   
   No additional global setup is needed - you're all set to use use context7 in any project!

> claude mcp list

● Bash(claude mcp list)
  ⎿  context7: npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest

● Perfect! Context7 is confirmed as your only configured MCP server and is available globally across all
  projects.

> are there any other tools that might be beneficial to naby projects like fetch maybe?

> how do i communicate to use these tools in my prompts

● Here are the specific ways to invoke each MCP server in your prompts:

  Reference Methods:

1. Using @ mentions (recommended):
   @filesystem read the contents of my project directory
   @fetch get the latest news from https://example.com
   @puppeteer take a screenshot of google.com
   @sequential-thinking help me solve this complex algorithm problem

2. Using "use" commands:
   How do I implement authentication in FastAPI? use context7

3. Natural language requests:
   Can you fetch the content from this website and analyze it?
   Take a screenshot of this webpage for me
   Help me think through this complex logic step by step
   
   Examples in Practice:
   
   For web development:
   @context7 @fetch Get the latest React documentation and fetch examples from the official website
   
   For file operations:
   @filesystem Create a new Python script in my Projects folder with error handling
   
   For complex problems:
   @sequential-thinking I need to design a database schema for a library management system. Walk me through
   the process step by step.
   
   For testing:
   @puppeteer Navigate to my localhost:8000 application and test the login functionality
   
   The MCP servers will automatically activate when you reference them with @ or mention their capabilities
   in your prompts!

● Here are practical example prompts for each MCP server:

  @context7 Examples:

  How do I implement JWT authentication in FastAPI with proper error handling? use context7

  What's the best way to handle database connections in SQLAlchemy 2.0? use context7

  Show me how to create responsive layouts with CSS Grid in 2024. use context7

  @filesystem Examples:

  @filesystem Please read all Python files in my current project and show me the overall structure

  @filesystem Create a new directory structure for a Flask web application with proper organization

  @filesystem Find all files containing "database" in their name across my Projects folder

  @fetch Examples:

  @fetch Please get the current Python documentation for FastAPI routing and summarize the key points

  @fetch Scrape the GitHub trending repositories page and show me the top 5 Python projects today

  @fetch Check if my website at http://localhost:8000 is responding and show me the homepage content

  @sequential-thinking Examples:

  @sequential-thinking I need to refactor a large Python codebase. Help me create a step-by-step plan
  considering dependencies, testing, and deployment.

  @sequential-thinking Walk me through designing a REST API for a library management system, considering all
   the endpoints, data models, and error handling.

  @sequential-thinking I'm getting a complex bug in my web application. Help me debug this systematically.

  @puppeteer Examples:

  @puppeteer Take a screenshot of https://github.com and save it to my Desktop

  @puppeteer Navigate to my local development server at localhost:8000 and test the login form with sample
  credentials

  @puppeteer Generate a PDF of this documentation website for offline reading

  Combined Examples:

  @context7 @fetch Get the latest FastAPI documentation and fetch examples from the official GitHub
  repository

  @filesystem @sequential-thinking Review my project structure and help me create a comprehensive testing
  strategy

   Yes! Combining multiple MCP servers in prompts is very powerful. Here are practical scenarios:

  Development Workflow Examples:

  Research → Implementation → Testing:
  @context7 @fetch @filesystem Get the latest React testing best practices, fetch examples from popular
  GitHub repos, then create a proper test structure in my project directory

  API Development & Documentation:
  @context7 @fetch @sequential-thinking Get current FastAPI documentation, check competitor APIs for
  patterns, then walk me through building a complete REST API with proper error handling

  Web Development & Testing:
  @filesystem @puppeteer @sequential-thinking Read my web project files, take screenshots of the current UI,
   then create a systematic plan for responsive design improvements

  Complex Problem Solving:

  Full-Stack Feature Development:
  @context7 @filesystem @sequential-thinking Research authentication patterns, analyze my current codebase
  structure, then create a step-by-step implementation plan for user login

  Performance Analysis:
  @fetch @puppeteer @sequential-thinking Test my website's load times, capture performance screenshots, then
   systematically identify bottlenecks and optimization strategies

  Database Migration:
  @context7 @filesystem @sequential-thinking Get current SQLAlchemy migration docs, examine my existing
  database files, then plan a safe migration strategy

  Real-World Scenario:

  @context7 @fetch @filesystem @sequential-thinking I'm building a library management system. Get the latest
   FastAPI and SQLAlchemy docs, fetch examples from similar projects, analyze my current project structure,
  then create a comprehensive development roadmap.

  The MCPs work together seamlessly - Context7 provides current docs, Fetch gathers examples, Filesystem
  handles files, Sequential-thinking creates plans, and Puppeteer tests results!

● The MCP server configurations are stored in:

  📁 /home/herb/.claude.json

  This is your global Claude Code configuration file. The MCP servers are defined at the end of the file in
  the mcpServers section:

  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {}
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", ...]
    },
    "fetch": {...},
    "sequential-thinking": {...},
    "puppeteer": {...}
  }

  Key points:

- Global config: Available to all projects since we used -s user

- Project-specific: Would be in .mcp.json files in individual projects

- Local-only: Would be in project-specific .claude.json files
  
  You can manually edit this file if needed, but using claude mcp add/remove commands is safer!
