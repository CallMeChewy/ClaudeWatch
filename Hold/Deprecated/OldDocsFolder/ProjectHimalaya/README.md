# Project Himalaya

A comprehensive framework demonstrating optimal AI-human collaboration, manifested through the development of practical applications that themselves leverage AI capabilities.

## Attribution

Project Himalaya is a collaborative effort between:

- **Herbert J. Bowers** (Project Creator and Director)
- **Claude** (Anthropic) - AI Assistant responsible for 99.99% of code and technical design

This project demonstrates the potential of AI-human collaboration by combining human vision and direction with AI implementation capabilities.

## Project Vision

Project Himalaya aims to create a comprehensive framework for AI-human collaborative development while building practical applications like the OllamaModelEditor. The project follows a layered architecture with a focus on documentation-driven development and knowledge persistence.

### Key Features

- 📚 **Documentation-Driven Development**: Documentation precedes implementation
- 🧩 **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with no module exceeding 500 lines
- 🔄 **Knowledge Persistence**: Mechanisms for maintaining context across development sessions
- 🧪 **Systematic Testing**: Comprehensive testing integrated from the beginning
- 🤝 **AI-Human Collaboration**: Optimized workflow between human creativity and AI capabilities

## Repository Status

This repository is currently being initialized with a clean structure. More documentation and code will be added soon.

*"Code is not merely functional—it is a visual medium that developers interact with for extended periods. The choices made in these standards prioritize the axis of symmetry, character distinction, readability at scale, and visual hierarchy."*
