Claude Monitor v3.0.0
The creator of this project has a great idea, but there are several areas that could make this tool a lot more useful and accurate.
The main issue is with Token and Message data. the percentages are mased on hard-coded constants. depending on various types of user activities, this data is misleading.
This tool is basically a wrapper or proxy that intercepts CLI communications between the API and the CLI. i would like to intercept additional data regarding rate limits. the cli receives a message about approaching limits. it also receives max limit reached messages. i would like to intercept those messages and record metrics about current CLI state, and have  the tool save each session's elapsed time etc, at these two occurrences. i would like to record them in a persistent db and have the tool use that data to refine the base values over time to provide data more attuned to the specific. The tool probably monitors a single common port. it would be nice if multiole terminal sessions were running the stats could be specific for each terminal using some type  of ip for each terminal.
